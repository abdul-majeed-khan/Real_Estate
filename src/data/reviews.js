After a month of discussions, decided to travel to Dubai and we met in their office. Bogdan took us around and showed us the options, explained the projects and booked the units. The true value is in the post sale service - he followed up with the developers on our behalf and sends us regular updates on the project status. Fully recommended!”",

    text: "“It is difficult to find transparent brokers nowadays but we have found ours! As investors not living in Dubai, this is the most important factor. We've met with sales manager Bogdan and company owner Marwan in their Dubai office. Bogdan managed the viewings and meetings with the developers, without pushing a specific one. Gave us the pros and cons transparently and even went to Ras Al Khaimah together. We booked the desired units and we are still in touch as he follows up on the progress. We are very happy with the decisions and we recommend their services. Thank you!”",

    text: "“Thank you Federico Bongiovanni! I'm an Italian real estate investor and I wanted to buy my second property in Dubai, but I didn't know the real estate market well yet. I needed someone to help me analyze opportunities and empathize with my needs. Throughout my time with Federico Bongiovanni, I never felt pressured alone and I felt very comfortable whenever he recommended a property. Federico is an exceptional professional who has extensive knowledge of the market and an unrivaled devotion to his work and I can assure you that his professionalism goes above and beyond the duty to secure and execute the right deal for his clients. He is an asset to the Platinum Square Real Estate agency.”",

    text: "“One of the best real estate brokers I have dealt with. I met many agents in Dubai, But Platinum Square were really different. You can feel the safe while they are working with you to reach the best deal they can, and provide you with valuable advice you can trust. You don't get the feeling that they are after commission, you can feel safe and secure, and that makes a huge difference. Dina Essam did a great job securing me a great deal and she was very patient with our preference, I can't express how professional she was. Also Mahmoud Reda and Walid provided valuable advice and input. I feel really lucky doing business with them”",
